                    and around 10
                    liters of fluid on average per stage – the last to replace the seven litre of fluids that you lose,
                    on average,
                    through sweat during each stage.</p>

                    <p class="ride__paragraph">For the rest of us plain old H2O will do. We’re losing more water
                        than minerals
